# Tic Tac Toe Project

Aaron, very nice.  I really like your function names, very semantic and the starts of great coding habits. This project bodes very well. I'll discuss more with you in person as this is a public repo, but you can see I left comments.  We'll go over what they mean and ways to continue to improve.
