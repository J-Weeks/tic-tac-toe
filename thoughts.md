## First Thoughts
-. I like how you started to break up your logic.  Declaring your variables
first.

-. I really like this.  Some people have set classes and toggle them, having
seperate scss attributes. But this is a great method as well.

```javascript
$('.box').css("background-color", "#151469");
```

-. Why this, why not use jquery here and the `.html()` method? ln31

```javascript
document.querySelector('.score')
```
